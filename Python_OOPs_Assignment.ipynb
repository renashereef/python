        "# Python OOPs Theoretical Questions with Answers\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain both data and methods. It emphasizes reusability, scalability, and modularity through features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes and behaviors that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "An object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained unit with its own attributes and methods defined by its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction hides complexity by showing only essential features.\n",
        "- Encapsulation hides internal state by bundling data and methods that operate on the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods with names like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`, etc. They are used to define the behavior of objects for built-in Python operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "Inheritance allows one class (child) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (parent). It supports reusability and method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism means having many forms. It allows the same interface to be used for different data types or classes, enabling method overriding and overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Encapsulation is achieved using private (`__variable`) and protected (`_variable`) access modifiers and getter/setter methods to control access.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "A constructor is a special method called `__init__` that gets called when a new object is created. It is used to initialize attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class methods use the `@classmethod` decorator and take `cls` as the first parameter. They access class variables.\n",
        "- Static methods use the `@staticmethod` decorator and don’t access class or instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Python does not support traditional method overloading. However, it can be mimicked using default arguments or `*args`/`**kwargs`.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "The `@property` decorator is used to define a method as a property. It allows accessing methods like attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows for flexible and reusable code. It lets different classes be treated through a common interface, improving scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "An abstract class cannot be instantiated and may have abstract methods. It is created using the `abc` module and serves as a blueprint for subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Modularity\n",
        "- Code reusability\n",
        "- Scalability\n",
        "- Data hiding\n",
        "- Ease of maintenance\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variable: Shared among all instances, defined at the class level.\n",
        "- Instance variable: Unique to each instance, defined in the constructor or instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class. Python supports this directly but requires careful handling of conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19. Explain the purpose of `__str__` and `__repr__` methods in Python.\n",
        "- `__str__`: Used to return a readable string representation of an object, used by `print()`.\n",
        "- `__repr__`: Returns an unambiguous string representation for developers/debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python?\n",
        "`super()` is used to call methods from the parent class, often used in constructors to initialize inherited attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "`__del__` is a destructor method that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is used for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- `@staticmethod`: Doesn’t take `self` or `cls`. Used for utility functions.\n",
        "- `@classmethod`: Takes `cls` and can modify class state.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Polymorphism allows child classes to provide different implementations of the same method defined in the parent class, enabling runtime method selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Method chaining is calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line by returning `self` from each method.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "The `__call__` method makes an object callable like a function. It allows an object to be used as if it were a function.\n"
